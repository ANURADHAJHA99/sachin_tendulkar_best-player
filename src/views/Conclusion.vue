        In the following anaysis we compared Sachin with legendary players of all time, some of which were his contemporary.The comparison was done in such a 
        fashion in order to prove the objective of the project, i.e Sachin is the best player of all time.

         The categories were choosen on the basis of the basic format of cricket, where the players play international Test or ODI.It is important to note however that no player 
        that t-20 format is not included as Sachin played only one international t-20 match.
        <br>
        <br>
       Sachin has a fair level of consistency in various categories, be it bowling or batting.
       <br>
       <br>
        After 2004, however a less aggressive form of playing technique is viewed, which has been addressed by sachin as pressure shield as a captain to

       <p class="big">
        Sachin is an Amazing individual player, he is able to easily play under pressure with his agressive batsmanship qualities, but he is an above Average Captain
        compared to his contemporaries.
